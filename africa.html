            <h1>ABOUT AFRICA</h1>
            <P>
                Africa, the second largest continent (after Asia), <br>covering about one-fifth of the total land surface of Earth. <br> The continent is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, <br>on the north by the Mediterranean Sea, on the east by the Red Sea <br>and the Indian Ocean, and on the south by the mingling waters of the <br>Atlantic and Indian oceans.
            </P>

        <h1>Why Africa?</h1>
        <p>Afirca is blessed with innumerable untapped mineral and human resources. It's scenary unmatched with any other continent. <br>Visit Africa to have a first hand experience of wildlife and nature at its finnest. Need suggestions on where to visit? Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda and South Afirca <br>should rank tallest in your bucket list. Africa contains an enormous wealth of mineral resources, including some of the worldâ€™s largest reserves of fossil fuels, metallic ores, <br>and gems and precious metals. This richness is matched by a great diversity of biological resources that includes the intensely lush equatorial rainforests of Central Africa and the world-famous populations of wildlife of the eastern and southern portions of the continent. Although agriculture (primarily subsistence) still dominates the economies of many African countries, the exploitation of these resources became the most significant economic activity in Africa in the 20th century.</p>

                <p>Everything about your life, about your body, grows! Your cells regenerate; <br> your hair, your nails, everything grows for your entire life. And your soul needs exploration and <br>growth.  And the only way you'll get it is by forcing yourself to be uncomfortable. Forcing yourself to get outside, out of your head.</p>
