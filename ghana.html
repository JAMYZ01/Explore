            <h1>ABOUT GHANA</h1>
            <P>
                Ghana is a multi-ethnic country with linguistic and <br>religious groups; while the Akan are the largest ethnic group, <br>they constitute a plurality. Most Ghanaians are Christians (71.3%);<br> almost a fifth are Muslims; a tenth practise traditional faiths or report no religion. <br> Ghana is a unitary constitutional democracy led by a president who is <br>head of state and head of government.

        <h1>Why GHANA?</h1>
        <p>In 2011, 1,087,000 tourists visited Ghana. Tourist arrivals include South  Americans, Asians, Europeans, and North Americans. <br> The attractions and tourist destinations include waterfalls such as Kintampo waterfalls and the largest waterfall in west Africa, Wli waterfalls, <br>the coastal palm-lined sandy beaches, caves, mountains, rivers, and reservoirs and lakes such as Lake Bosumtwi and the largest human-made lake in the world by surface <br> area, Lake Volta, dozens of forts and castles, World Heritage Sites, nature reserves and national parks. Some castles are Cape Coast Castle and the Elmina Castle. Castles mark where blood was shed in the slave trade and preserve and promote the African heritage stolen and destroyed through the slave trade. As a result of this, the World Heritage Convention of UNESCO named Ghana's castles and forts as World Heritage Monuments.
